CS 2223 Homework 5
Sarayu Vijayanagaram

This homework assignment contains two Java classes: "Hashing.java" and "DijkstraAlgorithm.java".

HASHING.JAVA
This class provides functionality for hashing words read from a file into a hash table and performs various operations on the hash table. These operations are: calculating load factor, finding the longest empty area, the longest cluster, the hash value with the most distinct words, and the word farthest from its actual hash value.

To run:
Compile the file. You will be prompted to enter a file name and the size of the hash table.

DIJKSTRAALGORITHM.JAVA
This class implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

To run:
Compile the file. You will be prompted to enter the source node (0 to n-1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph).
